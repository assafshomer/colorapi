[h]Creating a new testnet address[/h]

<table class="asaf"><tr><td>In this section we will create a new <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Testnet" target="_blank">TESTNET</a> Bitcoin address and fund it with test-bitcoins. The reason that we are using TESTNET is that issuing an asset requires funding and we don't want to spend real bitcoins in this tutorial.</td></tr></table> 

[i]create a new file in the same directory where you installed BitcoinJS and Node js[/i]
save the following into that file, say we call it <b>address.js</b>

First requiring the dependencies
[code]
// address.js
var bitcoin = require('bitcoinjs-lib');
[/code]
Creating a new bitcoin key object and extracting the TESTNET address 
[code]
// address.js
...
key = bitcoin.ECKey.makeRandom();
address = key.pub.getAddress(bitcoin.networks.testnet).toString();
console.log('new TESTNET address: ['+address+']');
wif = key.toWIF();
console.log('Private Key of new address (WIF format): ['+wif+']');
...
[/code]

Now launch a terminal window and type

[code]> node address.js
new TESTNET address: [n2t19a46cBs2DdHs2sqfRwPGhoQjvqmefR]
Private Key of new address (WIF format): [KzH9zdXm95Xv3z7oNxzM6HqSPUiQbuyKoFdQBTf3HKx1B6eYdbAn][/code] 

A new TESTNET address was printed to the screen.

<table class="asaf"><tr><td>Let's copy the new address we just generated and launch a web browser pointing to a testnet faucet, say <a href="http://tpfaucet.appspot.com/" target="_blank">this one</a>. Testnet faucets are websites that give away free test-bitcoins (which have no monetary value) so that developers can use them for testing Bitcoin software.</td></tr></table> 

Paste the newly generated testnet address you just created into the faucet, fill in the captcha and hit <b>send</b>. You are now the owner of (valueless) test-bitcoins!

<table class="asaf"><tr><td>To see your balance online you can use <a href="http://coloredcoins.org/explorer/testnet" target="_blank">our TESTNET explorer</a>. Paste your TESTNET address into the search box and hit the search button. You should see the test-bitcoin balance in your address.</td></tr></table>
