[i] <a href="https://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">node js</a> [/i]

In this section we show how to install node js so that anyone can follow the rest of the examples in this getting started guide.
Of course, node js is not mandatory for using our api, but since all the examples are written in node we present it here for completeness.

[i] Installing Node js [/i]

For example, on Linux (Ubuntu), launch a terminal window and type this to download the package:

[code]
> curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_0.12 | sudo bash -
[/code]

Now type this to install node js

[code]
> sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
[/code]

[i] Now verify installation [/i]

Open a text editor and save the following in a file called example.js
[code]
var http = require('http');
http.createServer(function (req, res) {
    res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});
    res.end('Colored Coins\n');
}).listen(1337, '127.0.0.1');
console.log('Server running at http://127.0.0.1:1337/');
[/code]

Now launch a terminal window and type

[code]
> node example.js
[/code]

Launch a web browser and visit <a href="http://127.0.0.1:1337/" target="_blank">localhost:1337</a>

You should see the text "Colored Coins"
